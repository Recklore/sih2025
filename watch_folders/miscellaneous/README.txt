================================
MISCELLANEOUS DOCUMENTS FOLDER
================================

Place documents here when you're UNSURE if they're static or dynamic:

✅ What to add:
- Documents that might contain both permanent and time-sensitive info
- Mixed content files
- Documents you're unsure how to classify

📝 Supported formats:
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- PowerPoint (.pptx)
- Excel (.xlsx)
- HTML files (.html)
- Plain text (.txt)

⚙️ How it works:
1. Drop your file here
2. The system automatically extracts text
3. AI analyzes the content
4. If confidence >= 60%: Added to either 'static' or 'dynamic' collection
5. If confidence < 60%: Added to BOTH collections for better coverage
6. Your chatbot can now answer questions about this content
7. Processed files are moved to watch_folders/processed/

💡 Smart Classification:
The system uses AI to automatically determine if content is:
- Static (permanent info) - confidence >= 60%
- Dynamic (time-sensitive) - confidence >= 60%
- Mixed (added to both) - confidence < 60%

⚠️ Note:
- Files are processed automatically within seconds
- Keep original copies elsewhere if needed
- Delete files here to remove them from the database
